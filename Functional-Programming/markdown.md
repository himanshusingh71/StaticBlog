** Functional  Programming **
 ================ ========= 


 ** What  is  Functional  Programming ? **
 -------------------------------- 



 Functional  programming  is  a  programming  paradigm  that  focuses  on  the  use  of  pure  functions ,  imm ut ability ,  and  the  avoidance  of  changing  state .  It 's  a  way  of  writing  code  that 's  declar ative ,  meaning  we  focus  on  what  we  want  to  achieve ,  rather  than  how  to  achieve  it .

 ** Key  Concepts **
 --------------- 



 ###  ** Pure  Functions **



 A  pure  function  is  a  function  that  always  returns  the  same  output  given  the  same  inputs ,  without  any  side  effects  or  mutable  state .  Pure  functions  are  the  building  blocks  of  functional  programming .

 *     A  function  should  be  able  to  be  called  multiple  times  with  the  same  arguments  and  produce  the  same  output .

 *     A  function  should  not  have  any  side  effects ,  such  as  modifying  external  data  or  performing  I /O  operations .

 *     A  function  should  always  return  a  value ,  never  throwing  exceptions  or  returning  null .

 ###  ** Immutable  Data  Structures **


 Immutable  data  structures  are  data  structures  that  cannot  be  changed  once  they 're  created .  This  means  that  when  we  want  to  modify  a  piece  of  data ,  we  create  a  new  copy  of  the  data  instead  of  modifying  the  original .

 ###  ** Higher - Order  Functions **


 Higher -order  functions  are  functions  that  take  other  functions  as  arguments  or  return  functions  as  output .  They 're  used  extensively  in  functional  programming  to  abstract  away  low -level  details  and  focus  on  the  logic  of  the  program .

 ** Advantages **
 --------------


 ###  ** E asier  Debug ging **


 Functional  programming  makes  it  easier  to  debug  code  because  each  function  has  a  single  responsibility ,  making  it  harder  for  errors  to  creep  in .

 ###  ** F aster  Code  Execution **

 Pure  functions  can  be  executed  faster  because  there 's  no  side  effect  or  mutable  state  to  worry  about .

 ###  ** Less  Bugs **

 Immutable  data  structures  reduce  the  chance  of  bugs  caused  by  modifying  shared  data .

 ** Disadvantages **
 --------------- 


 ###     Steeeper  Learning  Curve 

 Functional  programming  requires  a  different  mindset  than  traditional  object -oriented  programming ,  so  it  can  be  st eeper  to  learn .

 ###     More  Memory  Usage 


 Creating  new  copies  of  data  every  time  we  want  to  modify  it  means  that  functional  programs  might  use  more  memory  than  their  imperative  counterparts .


 ** Real - World  Applications **
 --------------------------


 ###  ** Data  Analysis **


 Functional  programming  is  well -su ited  for  data  analysis  tasks  because  it 's  easy  to  write  pure  functions  to  perform  complex  calculations  without  any  side  effects .


 ###     Web  Development 

 Higher -order  functions  are  useful  in  web  development  when  we  need  to  abstract  away  low -level  details  of  HTTP  requests  and  responses .
